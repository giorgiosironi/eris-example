This is really just an empty project which tries to install [Eris](http://github.com/giorgiosironi/eris).

We use this project to test the installation and to show a sample composer.json that does the job.

After running:
```
composer install
```
You are able to run examples of Eris PHPUnit tests with:
```
vendor/bin/phpunit vendor/giorgiosironi/eris/examples
```
Note that some of these tests fail to demonstrate some of Eris functionalities.
